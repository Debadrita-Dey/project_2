# Cellphone price prediction   
The Cellphone Price Prediction project aims to predict the prices of cellphones based on a variety of features such as brand, model, specifications, and other relevant attributes   
This project predicts cellphone price ranges based on various technical features and visualizes trends using a Power BI dashboard.      

## Objective   
- Classify cellphones into different price ranges using machine learning.   
- Visualize feature impact and distribution (e.g., battery, RAM, camera specs) using Power BI.   

## Features Used   
- RAM, battery power, camera resolution, screen size, processor cores, etc.   

## Tools & Libraries   
- Python, Pandas, NumPy   
- scikit-learn   
- Power BI   
- Jupyter Notebook
